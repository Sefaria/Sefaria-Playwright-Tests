# Sefaria Playwright Tests
Welcome! We're so grateful you're considering contributing to Sefaria's test coverage. We are so grateful for our enthusiastic community of developers. 

Playwright tests bulletproof Sefaria from bugs. They are easy to contribute and make our digital library more resilient. This repo uses issues and projects to manage volunteer contributions to tests. All pull requests will need to be to the main [Sefaria-Project](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project) repository.
